Inda  looks around for a second because she's never done this before.\nThere's no real socket or lever or anything. She just kind of takes a second and meditates on the concept of the wall itself.\nA wide enough hole in the middle of it opens for you all to cross.  Crudark walks in first, followed by Truvik, Dain and Lift. It appears to be an empty room. hesitantly Johann follows.\nWe move up to where the throne is and atop.  On the center spire of the back of the headrest of the throne is a silver crown made of star constellations. Crudark goes to  pick up the crown. As he attempts to remove the crown from the throne, Nothing happens. even with his great strength, It does not budge.  Inda approaches the throne and very easily lifts the crown and places it upon her head.\nalmost as she turns around and says, it seems fine. Then, raised platforms emerge from the ground.

The appendage emerges from pools of darkness that gather around your fingers, dripping with umbral essence that devours light and warmth alike. As you complete the gesture, the spectral hand launches forth, trailing wisps of shadow like smoke from a snuffed candle.\nThe hand seeks your target with unnatural purpose, fingers of crystallized darkness reaching to clutch at their very life force. Where it touches, shadows bloom like frost across their form, drinking deeply of their vitality and leaving behind a numbing cold that seeps into their bones. The touch leaves a mark of shadow upon them—a stain of darkness that clings like a curse, preventing the warm light of healing from finding purchase on their flesh.\n	Narrator	2025-10-29 06:47:54.676	2025-10-31 20:38:06.937
